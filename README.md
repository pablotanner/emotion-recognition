# General Information
## Bachelor Thesis
- Title: Automatic Facial Emotion Recognition through Information Fusion
- Author: Pablo Tanner (**mail@pablotanner.com**, feel free to message me for any questions)
- Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Manuel GÃ¼nther
## Dataset
AffectNet
## Libraries and Frameworks
- OpenFace: For facial feature extraction
- DeepFace: For facial recognition embedding extraction
- cuML: For GPU-accelerated machine learning models
- scikit-learn: For any other machine learning models not supported by cuML
- PyTorch: For deep learning models (MLP and SequentialNN)

## Important Notes
- This repository contains all the files and code used for the experiments, even if not included/utilized in the final thesis.
- Code that wasn't used should have a comment indicating so (e.g. "This was not used in final version")
- The code utilized for the visualizations can be found in /src/visualizations 
- I did my best to add comments indicating in what Section/for what Experiments the different code files were used
